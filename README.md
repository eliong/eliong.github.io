Google Analytics Tracking of a Tableau Public Dashboard
This was borrowed from here https://github.com/jjscarlett/jjscarlett.github.io

The Index.html page becomes the home page for https://eliong.github.io/ which is the name of the Github repository

Instructions from JJScarlett
All credit goes to JS. Instructions here for my personal reference

Add a Tableau Public dashboard to our tracking:

add a floating URL container with the URL https://jjscarlett.github.io/ (where jjscarlett is the account name hosting the repository)
set the container size to w=1 by h=1
set the container position to x=1 and y=1
How I did the whole thing

based on http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

create a repository "username.github.io" with your username
create a simple index.html file to the repository
sign up for Google Analytics
add Google Analytics code (Admin>>Property>>Tracking Info>>Tracking Code) to header
